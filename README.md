## Professional Introduction

I am a fourth-year mathematics major committed to making mathematics accessible, meaningful, and empowering for the next generation. I am passionate about teaching and helping students build confidence through clear explanations, creative problem-solving, and real-world applications. My work in mathematical modeling, data analysis, and interactive tools strengthens my ability to break down complex ideas and support student learning in engaging, practical ways. I look forward to inspiring future learners and contributing to a positive, growth-oriented educational environment.

## Project 1 – Mathematical Modeling: Gradient Descent Optimization

**Goal:** Model and solve optimization problems using gradient descent in one and two variables, and compare numerical results with analytical solutions.

**Highlights:**
- Formulated quadratic optimization problems in one and two variables  
- Derived analytical gradients and solved for exact minima  
- Implemented numerical gradient descent and compared convergence to the true solutions  
- Discussed the role of gradient descent in modern machine learning and artificial intelligence

## Project 2 – Data Analysis & Visualization: Fuel Consumption Regression

**Goal:** Predict fuel consumption for Army convoys using a linear regression model and communicate the results through visualizations and an interactive Shiny app.

**Highlights:**
- Generated a synthetic dataset of 150 convoy trips based on a provided regression model  
- Created scatterplots of fuel consumption versus weight, distance, and speed with regression lines  
- Interpreted regression coefficients in operational language for logistics planning  
- Built a Shiny app that calculates predicted fuel use from user inputs  

**Report:** [Part B – Fuel Consumption Data Analysis Report](Project%208-Part%20B.pdf)  
**Shiny App Code:** [app.R](app.R)

## Selected Visualizations

The repository includes R code for generating the following plots using synthetic convoy data:

- Vehicle weight vs fuel consumed  
- Distance traveled vs fuel consumed  
- Average speed vs fuel consumed  

See: `FuelConsumption.R`.
